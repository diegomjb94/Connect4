# Connect4

The classic Connect 4 game made in CLIPS.

This repository contains the project that you do together with other classmates in a fourth year career course. The project is made in CLIPS and simulates the game of Connect 4. You can play against the machine, since the project implements the min-max algorithm to determine which is the best move to execute in each turn.
